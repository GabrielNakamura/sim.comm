# sim.comm

## Description

# Simulations of metacommunities.

require(ape)
require(geiger)

## Usage

sim.comm(tree,SimClus=0.9,SimOver=0.9,limit=0,Ncomm=30,Nind=20,Nsp=5,filter=0.8,stop="abundance",LNDist=TRUE,pattern,gradual=FALSE)

## Arguments

# tree - A phylo object.
# SimClus - Phylogenetic similarity for phylogenetic clustering.
# SimOver - Phylogenetic similarity for phylogenetic overdispersion.
# limit - Limit to the gradual option.
# Ncomm - Number of communities.
# Nind - Number of individuals in each community.
# Nsp - Richness in each community.
# filter - Frequency of restriction by the filter.
# stop - Stopping criterion, "richness" or "abundance".
# LNDist - Logical argument. Use lognormal species abundance distribution.
# pattern - Name or vector with the pattern for simulate, "clustering","random","overdispersion". If is a vector, it must be the same length that the number of communities.
# gradual - Logical argument. Use gradual filter from SimClus or SimOver to limit.
